# Nabi Book Club
## A website built for the Nabi Book Club, dedicated mostly to korean literature.
This book club is dedicated to reading and discussing about Korean literature translated into English. We have monthly picks and at the end of the month we talk about our thoughts on our Discord server. Our picks vary between recent releases and older books, following the mood of the members throughout the year. The club is hosted by Elisa Biagiarelli. On her Instagram profile you can find a lot of recommendations on Korean and Asian literature, live talks with translators, movie reviews and much more.
