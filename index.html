                <h2>The Magical Language of Others</h2>
                <p>
                    The Magical Language of Others is a memoir told through letters sent from mother to daughter. <br> 
                    When Eun Ji Koh was fifteen her parents left America to go to work in South Korea, leaving her alone with her older brother. <br>
                    This book observes the after-effects on her psychological growth, and while telling the story of her family she makes the reader observe an entire generation of
                    Koreans that lived the war, the division of their country and their travelling to America hoping for something better. <br>
                    Through a very sharp, simple and effective writing style Eun Ji Koh tells a personal story that feels completely universal. <br>
                    The pages flow easily under the eyes but the weight they carry is definitely not light.

                <h2>In Limbo</h2>
                <p>
                    In Limbo by Deb JJ Lee was the Nabi Book Club pick for April. It's a graphic novel memoir written and drawn by the authour about her life moving from South Korea to America when she was very young, growing up in a country where she was a stranger and a lot of other topics.
                    It especially focuses on her high school years, the difficult relationship with her parents and the pressure and expectations of her mother; 
                    her few friendships and her struggle to keep them; plastic surgery and the Korean beauty standards; the worsening of her mental health.
                    All of this is portrayed in a very fast pace with the events feeling like they're slipping from your fingers and you can't hold onto them.
                    Reading this felt like reading water, something that flows very quickly that is also hard to stop and dive deep into it.
                    All of the topics are put together in a way that makes them feel incomplete somehow and makes you want more. This is something that happens very often with graphic novels and here it was very strong.
                    Also the choice of this very peculiar color palette maded the whole reading experience feel more dreamy and distant.
